# Note: All traits were made with the intention of adding events/other things relating to them
# eventually, even if not stated on the traits themselves. Also, all traits can and probably
# will change again! These are not final effects or values at all.
#
# The following categories are more for organizational purposes than anything else:
# Psychological  - Mentality or mind altering effects.
# Physical       - Body parts or other physical attributes.
